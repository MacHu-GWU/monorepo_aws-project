"""
In the CI/CD workflow, we must execute numerous steps sequentially.
However, not all steps are necessary in every situation. For instance, we only
intend to execute the container image building step on specific git branches.
To achieve this, we should create a set of Python functions that accept
a git branch name as input and return a boolean flag to indicate whether
a particular action should be performed. This module offers utility tools
for implementing these functions.
